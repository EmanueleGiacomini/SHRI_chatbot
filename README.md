# SHRI Chatbot
This repository contains a simple Spoken Dialogue System regarding the COVID-19 Emergency. The chatbot task is to reason and argue with the user regarding the pandemic and eventually update its belief of the world through spoken interaction.
The chatbot follows a pipeline structure in which voice input is transformed into text, later processed. Via regular expressions, input phrases are categorized and subsequently handled by the internal class Agent.

The project is developed by:
  - Rossella Bonuomo
  - Emanuele Giacomini
  - Veronica Vulcano
